## ⚙️ TODO: Setup Required (Non-Code Tasks)

### 🔥 Firebase Configuration (15-20 minutes)

#### Option 1: Using Firebase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize from project root
firebase init

# During setup, select: Realtime Database, Firestore, Storage

# Deploy optimized rules with indexes
firebase deploy --only database,firestore,storage
```
See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` section 8 for detailed instructions.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup (Firebase Console)

##### Step 1: Create Firebase Project
- [x] Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
- [x] Click "Add project"
- [x] Name it "SafeZone"
- [x] Follow wizard steps

##### Step 2: Add Android App
- [x] Click "Add app" → Android icon
- [x] Package name: `com.example.safezone` (or your custom)
- [x] Download `google-services.json`
- [x] Place in: `android/app/google-services.json`
- [ ] Add Gradle dependencies (see README)

##### Step 3: Add iOS App (if targeting iOS)
- [ ] Click "Add app" → iOS icon
- [ ] Bundle ID: `com.example.safezone`
- [ ] Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- [ ] Add to Xcode project: `ios/Runner/`

##### Step 4: Enable Authentication

- [x] Enable "Google" provider
- [x] Add support email
- [x] For Android: Add SHA-1 certificate fingerprint
  ```bash
  # Get SHA-1 (Windows)
  cd android
  ./gradlew signingReport
  ```
- [x] Download updated `google-services.json` after adding SHA-1

##### Step 5: Create Firestore Database
- [x] Go to Firestore Database
- [x] Click "Create database"
- [x] Start in "Production mode"
- [x] Choose region (closest to users)
- [x] Update security rules:
  ```javascript
  rules_version = '2';
  service cloud.firestore {
    match /databases/{database}/documents {
      match /users/{userId} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
      
      match /reports/{reportId} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow create: if request.auth != null;
        allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                                  resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

##### Step 6: Create Realtime Database

        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null",
        ".indexOn": ["userId", "status", "category", "createdAt"]
      },
      "users": {
        "$userId": {
          ".read": true,
          ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid === $userId"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

##### Step 7: Enable Storage
- [ ] Go to Storage
- [ ] Click "Get started"
- [ ] Start in "Production mode"
- [ ] Update storage rules:

        allow read: if true;
        allow write: if request.auth != null;
      }
      
      match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
